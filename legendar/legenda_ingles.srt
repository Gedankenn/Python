1
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.715
Spirit. Before I draw nearer to that
stone to which you point.

2
00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:19.294
Answer me one question.

3
00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:22.211
Are these the shadows of the things that
will be?

4
00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.690
Or are they shadows of the things that
may be, only?

5
00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:32.014
Spirit. Tell me!

6
00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:33.920
Is this my grave?

7
00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:35.499
What's it look like, genius?

8
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.913
No, Spirit! No!

9
00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:53.452
I will live in the past, the present,
and the future!

10
00:00:58.207 --> 00:00:59.201
I don't know what to do.

11
00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:00.106
I'm light as a feather.

12
00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:01.107
I'm happy as an angel.

13
00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:02.607
Merry as a schoolboy.

14
00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:08.062
Hello, there.

15
00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:08.699
Hey.

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.857
What's today, my fine fellow?

17
00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:12.532
Today? Duh, it's Christmas day.

18
00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:14.116
Christmas day.

19
00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:15.503
Then I haven't missed it.

20
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.168
The spirits have taken only one night.

21
00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:21.818
Hello!

22
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.766
Merry Christmas, ya old fountain.

23
00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:30.139
Merry Christmas, shiny X-1.

24
00:01:30.547 --> 00:01:32.318
Merry Christmas, Dr. Orpheus.

25
00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:34.836
Merry Christmas, Mr. Venture.

26
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.868
Merry Christmas, H.E.L.P.eR.

27
00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:40.277
Why didn't he wish me a merry Christmas?

28
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.264
Nobody wants a Dean-in-the-box!

29
00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:05.526
Oh, thank god.

30
00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.409
I thought I'd turned into a complete
p****.

31
00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:05.523
Yeah, do you people carry the, uh,
Joker-mobile?

32
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.907
No? Huh? How long?

33
00:03:11.652 --> 00:03:12.929
Still haven't gotten anything for the
boys?

34
00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:14.457
Hank's covered.

35
00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:17.486
I had my old bass restrung and I painted
over the zebra stripes.

36
00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:18.788
But Dean's a little...

37
00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:19.718
More feminine?

38
00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.867
Well, tougher to shop for.

39
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:25.230
What, didn't you see the Sears catalog
he's been accidentally leaving all over
the house for the past month?

40
00:03:26.478 --> 00:03:27.478
Wishbook 1976?

41
00:03:28.338 --> 00:03:32.085
Well, I guess the green machine I
ordered won't be showing up anytime
soon, either.

42
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.478
Are you guys done with the phone?

43
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.167
Oh, did one of you forget this?

44
00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:38.944
It was just lying here.

45
00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:43.356
Ho, ho, ho!

46
00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:45.444
You've reached dial center.

47
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.951
Today's special Christmas story is all
about Christmas in Holland.

48
00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.766
What are you doing, Hank?

49
00:03:53.812 --> 00:03:54.812
Nothing!

50
00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.049
Your present's not in there.

51
00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:57.376
What do you mean?

52
00:03:57.377 --> 00:04:00.117
I was just looking for the Christmas
videos.

53
00:04:01.127 --> 00:04:02.159
Oh, here they are.

54
00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:04.462
Miracle on 69 St.

55
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:05.834
Jingle Balls.

56
00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:06.881
Frothy the Blowman.

57
00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:08.172
Rudolph the Red-

58
00:04:08.303 --> 00:04:11.386
Ok, Hank. Listen, I need your help
putting up the lights. Ok?

59
00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:14.081
Like holding the staple gun is helping.

60
00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:16.656
What are those elves doing to that lady?

61
00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.863
They're dwarves, Hank.

62
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320
Come on.

63
00:04:19.572 --> 00:04:21.327
Hey. Baby Jesus is out of the manger.

64
00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:25.173
Huh? Oh. That doesn't go there til
midnight.

65
00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:26.527
Venture tradition.

66
00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:36.659
That was close.

67
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.660
Get out of there, Tiny Joseph.

68
00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:38.766
Your work is done.

69
00:04:38.813 --> 00:04:39.813
Return to base.

70
00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:44.186
We almost lost one of our agents.

71
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.660
Granted, his specialty is pretty
limited.

72
00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:51.933
But he's an irreplaceable element of my
sexy new plan to destroy Dr. Venture.

73
00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:53.347
What plan?

74
00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:57.426
It was supposed to be a surprise... for
you.

75
00:04:57.592 --> 00:04:58.592
...for Christmas.

76
00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:01.403
Killing your archenemy on Christmas Eve.

77
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.228
That's a gift for me?

78
00:05:03.378 --> 00:05:05.918
Well, I got you some stocking stuffers
too.

79
00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:08.095
Unbelievable. The selfishness.

80
00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:09.710
You hate him too!

81
00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:12.248
Or were you just lying on our first
date?

82
00:05:13.253 --> 00:05:14.943
So what's the big plan?

83
00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:17.009
I'm glad you asked.

84
00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:18.512
Behold!

85
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.349
Tiny Joseph has managed to slip into the
Venture Compound and cleverly booby trap
it.

86
00:05:24.837 --> 00:05:25.852
At the strike of midnight,

87
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.659
Dr. Venture will place his precious
porcelain baby Christ in its manger,

88
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:35.435
And when he does, it will set off a
series of explosions

89
00:05:36.034 --> 00:05:39.195
That will deck his halls with boughs of
Venture!

90
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:41.366
What?

91
00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:43.987
That model was supposed to be a
surprise.

92
00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:45.957
I peeked.

93
00:05:53.823 --> 00:05:54.525
Oh, yeah.

94
00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:55.526
I know her type.

95
00:05:56.447 --> 00:05:57.447
Watch and learn.

96
00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.986
Ok- 1. You're totally gay.

97
00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:02.852
2. She's hot and you're an albino.

98
00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:05.294
And 3. You're totally gay.

99
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.442
You know, I was the first DJ at my
college radio station to play the
Bauhaus.

100
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.917
That's great. Wow, that makes you, like,
60 or something, huh?

101
00:06:15.162 --> 00:06:16.329
No, just cool.

102
00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:18.309
Mistletoe.

103
00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:23.336
Dad, I can take care of myself, ya know.

104
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.598
I'm sorry, pumpkin.

105
00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:28.640
I trust you to defend your honor.

106
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.870
It's just that...

107
00:06:30.696 --> 00:06:34.234
My pumpkin's maiden head is not a prize
to be--

108
00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:35.385
Dad!

109
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.130
Oh, Orpheus.

110
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:39.976
I wasn't expecting you to show up.

111
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:42.509
I didn't think necromancers believed in
Christmas.

112
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:46.053
Well, the whole affair is about as real
as Kwanzaa

113
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.914
or the Wookiees' Life Day.

114
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.070
But I find it charming.

115
00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.647
--then the camels ate the straw and left
a beautiful toy in its place.

116
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:59.274
That gay albino is hitting on your
not-girlfriend.

117
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.173
Wait, what? That's it?

118
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.540
What does that even mean?

119
00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:05.290
The camels poo toys?

120
00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:07.184
Hello? Hello?

121
00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:10.109
Well, did you get a good one?

122
00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:14.327
No, and I maxed out Pop's Diner's Club
card so we can't call anymore.

123
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.349
Well, we can't just bail on Christmas
story time.

124
00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:18.469
It's tradition!

125
00:07:18.617 --> 00:07:19.617
How about Grinch?

126
00:07:19.782 --> 00:07:20.782
Nah. Did it last year.

127
00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:22.652
Wait. I know.

128
00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.452
Dr. Orpheus brought this old book with
him.

129
00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:26.894
He used it when he was baking those
gingerbread cookies,

130
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.091
but maybe it's got some good Christmas
stories in it.

131
00:07:33.664 --> 00:07:37.012
[LATIN]

132
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.836
And I can't go into the details this
early in the process, but let's just
say...

133
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.119
[LATIN]

134
00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:46.672
Oh, dread!

135
00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:49.019
[LATIN]

136
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.597
Oh, this makes zero sense.

137
00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:55.572
I'm too late.

138
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.040
For even now, the beast approaches.

139
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.436
What? Who is this ****?

140
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.810
He's blowing my big thing.

141
00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:08.955
Look at that costume!

142
00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:12.216
What the hell is that thing?

143
00:08:12.646 --> 00:08:15.453
I'm afraid we're being visited upon by
the Krampus.

144
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.540
The punitive spirit who once rode
side-by-side with St. Nicholas each
Christmas Eve.

145
00:08:20.962 --> 00:08:25.375
Delivering terrible punishment to wicked
children as Claus bestowed his gifts
upon the righteous.

146
00:08:25.767 --> 00:08:26.761
That's ridiculous.

147
00:08:26.762 --> 00:08:28.416
There's no such thing as Santa Claus.

148
00:08:28.637 --> 00:08:31.950
Not since he was killed by a jet in
1963, no.

149
00:08:32.568 --> 00:08:36.860
Nor has there been a Krampus since the
pope cast him into purgatory during
Vatican II.

150
00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:41.630
But your boys seem to have inadvertently
released him from his chambers.

151
00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:42.825
Dean did it!

152
00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:43.906
I wanted to read the Grinch.

153
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.700
Um, Dad?

154
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.535
What kind of kinky Christmas spirit is
that?

155
00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:50.535
It is Germanic in origin.

156
00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:54.194
Well, can't you just, I don't know,
magic it away or something?

157
00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:57.265
No more than you could science it away.

158
00:08:57.989 --> 00:09:02.989
No, the beast will not stop until it has
punished the wicked in this house.

159
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:05.724
Well, there's no one wicked--

160
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.471
What the hell?

161
00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:10.407
Oh, for the love of...

162
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.203
Ok, that's it, Mister.

163
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:16.361
Brock!

164
00:09:17.784 --> 00:09:18.784
Hey, Fancy Pants.

165
00:09:19.237 --> 00:09:20.237
I've been naughty.

166
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.955
Come into my house on Christmas?!

167
00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:29.663
You want some of this?!

168
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.763
Come on, you piece of Christmas s***!

169
00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:41.828
Stay your hand, Mr. Samson.

170
00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:43.812
It's midnight.

171
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.330
It's Christmas day.

172
00:09:46.963 --> 00:09:49.289
It's earthly work is at an end.

173
00:09:58.746 --> 00:09:59.577
Doc.

174
00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:00.578
Doc!

175
00:10:01.082 --> 00:10:02.082
You were having a nightmare, Doc.

176
00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:03.745
So, everything's ok, then?

177
00:10:03.976 --> 00:10:04.900
Not exactly.

178
00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:06.494
We kind of have a situation here.

179
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.611
The X-1 crashed, radio's dead, and we're
in hostile territory.

180
00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:12.615
Where?

181
00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:14.017
Bethlehem.

182
00:10:14.462 --> 00:10:16.308
Daddy, you're alive!
Pop, you're ok!

183
00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:18.509
This is the best Christmas present ever.

184
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:20.912
Hey, Pop. We saw where Jesus was born.

185
00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.384
And there was, like, magical god-fire
shooting out of it and everything.

186
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.253
Just like in Ten Commandments.

187
00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:27.728
I think we hit a gas main.

188
00:10:28.434 --> 00:10:29.454
So, what do we do here, Brock?

189
00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:30.716
Well, that all depends.

190
00:10:30.872 --> 00:10:32.957
If the Israelis get here first, we might
have a chance.

191
00:10:33.127 --> 00:10:34.339
I know some guys in the...

192
00:10:35.273 --> 00:10:37.182
If the PLO shows up, well...

193
00:10:38.183 --> 00:10:39.364
My Arabic's a little shaky.

194
00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:41.016
Not a problem.

195
00:10:41.017 --> 00:10:43.641
Did you forget? This baby runs on pure
plutonium.

196
00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:45.228
They're gonna love us!

197
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.531
And that's what Christmas is all about.
